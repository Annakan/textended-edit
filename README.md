# Structure Editor, for .t+ -files.

If you decide to try it, make sure you've got pysdl2, pyopengl and textended. I've tried it with python 2.7

You can obtain textended by:

    git clone https://github.com/cheery/textended/

On Windows platform you might not find SDL2_image. It is available in: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ Place it into the PYSDL2_DLL_PATH.

There's an IRC channel #essence in irc.freenode.net, for those who like to discuss about visual programming/structured editing.
